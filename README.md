# Steam data tracker

## Setup && Installation

First you'll want to export your `STEAM_API_KEY` and `STEAM_ID`

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
export STEAM_API_KEY='gabe_is_love'
export STEAM_ID='gabe_is_life'
```

## Run

Now you can run the script manually with `./steam-data-downloader.sh` or set it
up with a chronjob.
